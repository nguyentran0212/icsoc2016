			<h1>Call for Workshops</h1>
			<!--h2>ICSOC 2016 - The 14th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing</h2-->
		
			<p>The 14th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the main conference. The workshop program seeks to provide venues for specialist groups to meet, to generate focused discussion on specific sub-areas within Service Oriented Computing and to engage in community-building activities. The workshops should provide a discussion forum for researchers in topics related to main theme of the conference, either on specific research themes or in emerging areas of research.</p>
		
			<p>The workshops will be held on 10 October 2016 at the Alberta, Canada.</p>
		
			
			<h3>Important Date</h3>
			
			<ul class="list-arrow-right">
				<li>Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: April 11 2016 </li>
				<li>Workshop Acceptance Notification: May 08 2016</li>
				<li>Workshop Notification Deadline: August 14 2016</li>
				<li>Early Registration Deadline: August 15 2016</li>
				<li>Camera Ready Paper & Copyright: August 30 2016</li>
				<li>Workshops: October 10 2016</li>
			</ul>
            
           <h3>Workshop Organization</h3>
           <p> Workshop organizers will be responsible for the following:</p>
           <ul class="list-arrow-right" >
				<li> Constituting the workshop program committee </li>
                <li> Advertising the workshop </li>
                <li> Managing the paper review and selection process </li>
                <li> Ensuring that at least one author of each accepted paper attends to present the paper (this may require announcing regulations that stipulate this as a prerequisite for the publication of the paper in the workshop proceedings.) </li>
                <li> Ensuring that the workshop delivers useful scholarly / research value via active discussion / debate.</li>
                <li> Workshops may be held for a full day or for half a day.</li>
                <li> At least one author for each paper accepted to a workshop will need to register for the workshop program.</li>
           </ul>     

			<h3>Workshops Publication</h3>
			
			<p>The conference solicits outstanding original research and practice papers on all aspects of service-oriented computing. Papers should clearly demonstrate the research or practical contribution, the relevance to the field, and the relationship to prior work. Submitted papers will be evaluated according to their rigor, significance, originality, technical quality, and exposition. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. It is likely that, as in previous years, the post-proceedings of the accepted workshops will be jointly published as a Springer volume. A formal proposal to Springer will only be made after the accepted workshops and their program committees are finalized. Workshops organizers can opt out of the volume should they wish to; a decision on this is required at workshop submission stage for planning purposes.</p>
			
            <p>Working notes of the workshops (including papers to be eventually published in the joint workshop volume) will be printed locally for distribution on the workshop day. </p>
			
            <h3>Workshop Proposal Submissions</h3>
            
            <p>Workshop proposal shall be submitted to workshop co-chairs at <b>wc AT icsoc DOT org </b> and should include the following information: </p>
			
			<ul class="list-arrow-right">
				<li>Workshop title </li>

                <li>A list of likely program committee members </li>
                <li>A description of the paper review and selection process (it is recommended that each paper is reviewed by 3 distinct members of the workshop program committee) </li>
                <li>An estimate of the number of submissions that will be attracted on the basis of workshops held in previous years or any other information </li>
	            <li>Plans for invited talks if any </li>
