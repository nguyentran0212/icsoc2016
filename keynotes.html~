			<h2>Title: Security and Privacy in the IoT</h2>
			<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems,  and/or other connected devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT makes it possible to sense and control objects creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. IoT will usher automation in a large number of application domains, ranging from manufacturing and energy management (e.g. SmartGrid), to healthcare management and urban life (e.g. SmartCity). However, because of its fine-grained, continuous and pervasive data acquisition and control capabilities, IoT raises concerns about the security and privacy of data. Deploying existing data security solutions to IoT is not straightforward because of device heterogeneity, highly dynamic and possibly unprotected environments, and large scale. 
				<br> In this talk, after outlining key challenges in data security and privacy, we present initial approaches to techniques and services for securing IoT data, including efficient and scalable encryption protocols, software protection techniques for small devices, and fine-grained data packet loss analysis for sensor networks.

serves as Director of Purdue Cyber Center and Research Director of the
Center for Information and Research in Information Assurance and
Security (CERIAS). She is also an adjunct  professor of Computer Science
& Info Tech at RMIT. Prior to joining Purdue in 2004, she was a
professor and department head at the Department of Computer Science and
Communication of the University of Milan. She has been a visiting
researcher at the IBM Research Laboratory (now Almaden) in San Jose, at
the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, at Rutgers
University, at Telcordia Technologies. Her recent research focuses on
data security and privacy, digital identity management, policy systems,
and security for drones and embedded systems. She is a Fellow of ACM and
of IEEE. She received the IEEE Computer Society 2002 Technical
Achievement Award, the IEEE Computer Society 2005 Kanai Award and the
2014 ACM SIGSAC outstanding contributions award.  She is currently

			<h2>Title: Revisiting Service-oriented Architecture for the IoT: A Perspective</h2>
			<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising concept toward pervasive
computing and one of the major paradigm shifts that the computing era is
facing today. In the IoT, everyday objects, the “Things”, get networked
so that they can cooperate autonomously, and allow humans to interact
with the physical world as simply as they do with the virtual world.
However, the IoT paradigm raises tremendous challenges from the
networking up to the application layers, in particular due to extreme
heterogeneity, scale and dynamics that it introduces.
			<br> In this talk, I will explore how service-oriented architecture may be
revisited to address challenges posed by the IoT for the development of
distributed applications. Drawing from our past and ongoing work within
the MIMOVE team at Inria Paris, I will in particular discuss the
evolution of the supporting middleware solutions spanning the
introduction of: probabilistic protocols to face scale, cross-paradigm
interaction to face heterogeneity, and streaming-based interactions to
support the inherent sensing functionality brought in by the IoT. I will
further illustrate the proposed solutions in the context of
citizen-centric urban systems oriented toward smarter cities, which
leverage the many Things deployed in the environment, both fixed and
mobile as carried by people.

			Bio: <a href="https://mimove.inria.fr/members/valerie-issarny/">Dr. Valérie Issarny</a> holds a “Directrice de recherche” position at Inria, the French
institute for research in Information and Communication Science
and Technologies, where she led the ARLES research team until 2013,
investigating distributed software systems leveraging wirelessly
networked devices, with a special emphasis on
service-oriented computing. Valérie in particular studies middleware
solutions easing the development of distributed collaborative services,
including mobile services deployed over smartphones and interacting
with sensors and actuators. Since summer 2013, Valérie is the scientific
coordinator of the <a href="https://project.inria.fr/siliconvalley/">Inria@SiliconValley program</a> promoting and fostering
collaboration between Inria and California universities. She is also
coordinating the <a href="https://citylab.inria.fr/">Inria CityLab program</a> dedicated to smart cities and promoting citizen engagement; the program
is developed in collaboration with CITRIS at University of California
Berkeley and targets urban-scale experiment in Paris and California
cities.  Ongoing projects include <a href="https://citylab.inria.fr/urban-civics/">Urban Civics</a> on urban pollution monitoring
through participatory sensing and crowd sourcing, and <a href="https://citylab.inria.fr/appcivist-social-apps/">Appcivist</a> on a middleware
platform for democratic assembly and collective actions.
